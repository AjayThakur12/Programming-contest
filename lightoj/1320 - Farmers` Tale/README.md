#### Topics:
    Geometry

#### Key Idea:
    
For each line in the input, think in how many parts would increase the answer. Note that 
the current line can intersect with many lines in the same point, take care with this case.

#### Notes:

Don't use double operations, this may cause problems for precision. I recommend create a "Fraction" (in my case named point) class for calculations.
This tutorial helps me a lot for representing the lines and find their intersection :
