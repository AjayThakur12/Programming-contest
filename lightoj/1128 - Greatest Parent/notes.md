### Topics:
    -LCA.
    -DP.

## Key idea:

This problem is easy to solve if you think before in a LCA algorithm.
My code uses a O<N log N> for precomputing and O<log N> for solve each query.

The algorithm is based in the TopCoder tutorial: http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=tutorials&d2=lowestCommonAncestor
