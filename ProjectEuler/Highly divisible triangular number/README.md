### Topics:
    Prime factorization
    
    
### Key Idea:
    Factorize the number, then the number of divisor is the multiplication of each exponent +1.
    i.e. Take the number 15, his prime factorization is 3^1 * 5^1, therefore his number of divisors is 4 (2*2) {1,3,5,15}.
    
### Notes:
    When calcule the prime factorization of a number, just iterate to sqrt(n), and after you divide n by any prime factor
    update sqrt(n).
    With this improvement, the time can be halved. (in practice cases).
