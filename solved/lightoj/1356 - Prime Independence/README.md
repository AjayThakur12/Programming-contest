    Max bipartite matching, Dinic, Max Flow

### Key idea

> "Think every number is a vertex, draw an edge between a and b if a and b is conflict. Your goal is to find the maximum independent set. Since if a and b is conflict, if a has even number of prime factors, b must have odd number of prime factors. Thus this graph is bipartite. Bipartite graph maximum independent set is easy to solve." - **Liu Qi**
