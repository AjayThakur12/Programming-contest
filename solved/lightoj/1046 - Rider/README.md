    BFS


### Key Idea

For each rider find the shortest path to every other cell, also you will need to keep how many riders can reach each cell.

Then for each cell (i, j), if the number of riders that can reach that cell is equals to the total number of riders, update the answer
with the best value, ie. The sum of all shortest path ending in (i, j)
