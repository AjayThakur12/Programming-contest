    Binary search, greedy


### Key Idea

Do a binary search in order to find the maximum m which is valid.

You can check greedily if is possible to attack using at most s snipers.

Think in a case with two soldiers ordered by x, the first one is very close
to k, but the second one is far from k. How many snipers do you need ?
