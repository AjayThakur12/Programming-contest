PROBLEM STATEMENT
We are interested in pairs of strings (A, B) that satisfy the following conditions: 

A and B consist of exactly n characters each. 
Each character in A and B is one of the first k lowercase letters of the English alphabet. 
There exists a string C such that A + C = C + B. Here, + denotes string concatenation. 

For example, if n = 3 and k = 4 then one valid pair of strings is ("aad", "daa"): 
both strings have length 3, only the first 4 letters are used in each of them, and C = "aa" shows that the third condition is satisfied as well. 

You are given the ints n and k. 
Find the number of such pairs of strings, and return the number modulo 1,000,000,007.
